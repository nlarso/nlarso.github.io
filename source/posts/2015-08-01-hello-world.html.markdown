Hello world! Again! My last blog post was in 2012, which(as of this writing) was over three years ago. I never meant to go so long without writing anything, but admittedly my attention in 2012 was much more focused on finishing the last year of my undergraduate degree than it was on updating this blog.

Excuses aside, I'm ready to start blogging again. I've rebuilt this website in _Middleman_ and ditched _Wordpress_(More details on the how and why in my next post, I promise).

Until then, check out my [about me](/about) page to see what I've been up to for the past three years.
