    <p>Hello! I'm a full-stack software engineer who specializes in web
    application development with Ruby on Rails. I'm passionate about writing
    clear, concise and well tested code.</p>

    <p>As a full-stack developer, I work extensively with Ruby on Rails,
    Docker, MiniTest, Git, Unix/Linux, MySQL/PostgresSQL, HTML/ERB/HAML,
    CSS/SASS, and Javascript/jQuery/Coffeescript.</p>

    <p>I'm constantly striving to improve my craft and find that there is
    always more to learn. Recently I've been spending my spare time learning
    Swift(iOS), ReactJS and Rspec/Capybara.</p>
